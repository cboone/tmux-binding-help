## PR Review

- **Cross-file link consistency**: When flagging URL mismatches between files, verify which URL is correct before suggesting a change. The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file is the authoritative project reference; if a URL differs elsewhere (e.g., README.md), the other file is more likely wrong.
